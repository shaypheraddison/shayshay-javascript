// # Create a calculator
// # This seems simple but we are going to make it just like a traditional
// # calculator where the user can enter any values and any operand
// # Example: 
//     # input: 5 + 10 - 2 / 15 * 20 + 99999
//     # output: the result of above
// # make sure to handle any data type such as int and floats
// # make sure to apply the correct mathmetical sequence to process the equation
